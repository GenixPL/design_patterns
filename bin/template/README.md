## Behavioral Patterns

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets
subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Main difference between Strategy and Template patterns is that the Strategy focuses on dynamic behaviour changes and
Template wants everything to be predefined.
