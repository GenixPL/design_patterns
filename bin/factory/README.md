## Creational Patterns

The idea behind factories is to isolate a creation of an object from a code that needs it, e.g., when we don't care
about anything else other than stuff exposed through an interface.

- We can hide all additional creation logic, e.g., we can hide assemble logic from the rest of the code.
- We can reuse already created objects that are available to us.
